This is a fork of MOODS version 1.0.1 it adds an additionaly python object
`MOODSSearch` that lets you run many search with minimal parameter 
reloading overhead so that you don't need to concatenate searches 
and then parse the results to get speed ups with `MOODS.search`

# MOODS version 1.0.1
=======================

MOODS is a suite of algorithms for matching position weight matrices (PWM) against DNA sequences. It features advanced matrix matching algorithms implemented in C++ that can be used to scan hundreds of matrices against chromosome-sized sequences in few seconds.

MOODS has been designed to be used as a library wherever PWM matching is needed. It can be used as standalone analysis tool or as a component in larger programs. It contains interfaces for BioPerl and Biopython toolkits. MOODS can thus be easily called from C++, Python and Perl programs.

MOODS is licenced under GPL version 3 license and under the Biopython license, so you may use it under terms of either of those licenses. See COPYING.GPLv3 and COPYING.BIOPYTHON files for license details.

## INSTALLATION

You need to compile the C++ library before installing the Perl and Python interfaces. This can be done by running "make" in the "src" directory.

Installing extensions:
- For perl extension see perl/README.
- For python extension see python/README.md
